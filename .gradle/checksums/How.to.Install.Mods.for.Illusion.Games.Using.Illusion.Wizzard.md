## Step 1: Download and Extract Illusion Wizzard
 
You can download Illusion Wizzard from [this link](https://github.com/aa2g/AA2Install/releases). The latest version is v7.1, which requires .NET 4.5.2 or higher to run. If you are using Windows XP, you can use v7 beta 2.1, which is compatible with .NET 4.0. After downloading the zip file, extract it to a new folder of any name anywhere. We will refer to this folder as `<IllusionWizzard>`.
 
## Step 2: Create a Game Profile
 
Before you can use Illusion Wizzard to install mods, you need to create a game profile for the game you want to mod. To do this, open Illusion Wizzard and click on the `New` button at the bottom left corner. A dialog box will pop up asking you to select the game folder of the game you want to mod. Navigate to the game folder and click `OK`. Illusion Wizzard will then scan the game folder and create a game profile for it. You can see the game profile name and icon at the top left corner of Illusion Wizzard.
 
## Step 3: Download and Apply Mods
 
Now that you have created a game profile, you can start downloading and applying mods for your game. There are many sources of mods for Illusion games, such as [HongFire](https://www.hongfire.com/forum/forum/hentai-lair/hf-modding-translation), [Anime-Sharing](https://www.anime-sharing.com/forum/illusion-games-125/), and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/illusion-games-2019-23910049). Most mods come in zip or 7z format, which are compatible with Illusion Wizzard. To apply a mod, simply drag and drop the zip or 7z file into the `Mods` tab of Illusion Wizzard. You will see the mod name, author, version, description, and preview image in the list. You can also search for mods by typing keywords in the search bar at the top right corner.
 
To install a mod, select it from the list and click on the `Apply` button at the bottom right corner. A dialog box will show you the changes that will be made to your game files. Click `OK` to confirm and wait for Illusion Wizzard to finish installing the mod. You can also install multiple mods at once by selecting them with Ctrl or Shift keys and clicking on the `Apply selected` button.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Your Modded Game
 
After installing your mods, you can launch your game from Illusion Wizzard by clicking on the `Play` button at the bottom left corner. You can also launch your game normally from its shortcut or executable file. You should see your mods working in your game. Have fun!
